In this project, I tried to implement ui with my own code instead of iOS system based controller to avoid iOS version specific ui layout errors and crashes. It was a nice try, but a whole exchanged is not necessary, after this project we began to use our own special controls. </p>

            <p class="heading">Reason for leaving:</p>

            <p class="text">Mobile development is a promising work, I like it so much. </p>

            <p class="text">More than 3 years experience on iOS development makes me have some understanding of this area. </p>

            <p class="text">In the current situation, due to bottlenecks of hardware, technology and cost constraints, the future of Mobile Office will be more and more depending on Cloud Computing and intelligent input thin clients. I can say that, in a long time, Mobile Office will make better user experience, but is not able to alternative to PC‘s place. </p>

            <p class="text">At the same time, the Mobile Games, portable, simple, interruptible, the killer of time pieces, will play an more important role than PC games. </p>

            <p class="text">I want to work on it.</p>
